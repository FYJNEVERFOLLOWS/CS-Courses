# In speech perception, speech signal is decomposed into a number of frequency bands. Please explain the deference between human perception（the auditory models） and Fourier transformation.





# Please explain the relation of the linear spectral frequency (LSF) and the linear predictive coding (LPC).





# The LPCNet uses the traditional algorithm of LPC to increase the calculation effectiveness. Do you have any idea to combine other traditional algorithms into the neural network?





# Please describe the relationship between GMM-HMM and DNN-HMM based speech recognition systems. How to calculate P(X|W) by DNN?











# Please summarize the advantages and disadvantages of DNN-HMM and end-to-end ASR system, and explain the main solutions to address these disadvantages of end-to-end ASR system.















# What is the difference between generative embedding with DNN i-vector and deep speaker embeddings? How to extract X-vector embeddings?





# Read one or more the latest papers about a certain cutting-edge research topic related to acoustic processing; summarize and report the key challenges, novelty and contribution of the referred paper; give your own comments on the referred paper, not limited to its limitations, potential developments, future extensions, etc.
